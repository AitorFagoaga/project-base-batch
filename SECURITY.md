## Smart Contract Security

### Architecture

The platform uses two main smart contracts:

1. **Reputation.sol** - Two-layer reputation system
2. **Launchpad.sol** - All-or-nothing crowdfunding

### Security Features

‚úÖ **OpenZeppelin Libraries**
- Uses audited, battle-tested contract libraries
- `AccessControl` for admin permissions
- `ReentrancyGuard` for reentrancy protection

‚úÖ **Access Control**
- Genesis awards require `ADMIN_ROLE`
- Only project creators can claim funds
- Users cannot boost themselves

‚úÖ **Input Validation**
- Zero-amount checks on transfers
- Deadline validation (1-365 days)
- Minimum goal validation (0.01 ETH)
- Cooldown enforcement on boosts (24 hours)

‚úÖ **Safe Math**
- Solidity 0.8.20 built-in overflow protection
- No manual SafeMath required

### Contract Interactions

#### Read Operations (No Risk)
```solidity
// These operations only read blockchain state
reputationOf(address)
boostPower(address)
getProject(uint256)
projectCount()
```

#### Write Operations (Require User Approval)
```solidity
// All state-changing operations require:
// 1. User wallet signature
// 2. Transaction gas payment
// 3. On-chain execution

createProject(...)      // Creates new project
fundProject(...)        // Sends ETH to contract
claimFunds(...)         // Withdraws ETH (if goal reached)
boost(address)          // Awards reputation points
awardGenesis(...)       // Admin only - awards reputation
```

### Known Limitations (By Design)

‚ö†Ô∏è **No Refund Mechanism (MVP)**
- Once project goal is reached, funds cannot be refunded
- Backers should only fund projects they trust
- Future versions will add refund capability

‚ö†Ô∏è **Genesis Awards are Centralized**
- Only admin(s) can award Genesis reputation
- This is intentional for quality control
- Future versions may add DAO governance

‚ö†Ô∏è **No Project Cancellation**
- Once created, projects cannot be deleted
- Creators should test thoroughly before creating
- Future versions will add cancellation feature

## Frontend Security

### Environment Variables

‚úÖ **Proper Configuration**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Public variables (safe to expose)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=84532
NEXT_PUBLIC_REPUTATION_ADDRESS=0x...
NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCHPAD_ADDRESS=0x...

# ‚ùå Bad: Never put private keys in frontend!
# NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY=... # NEVER DO THIS!
```

**Why `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix?**
- Next.js only exposes variables with this prefix to the browser
- Prevents accidental exposure of backend secrets
- Contract addresses are public (on blockchain) so safe to expose

### No Server-Side Secrets

The frontend is a static site with no backend:
- No API keys stored in frontend code
- No private keys in the application
- All wallet operations use user's browser wallet

### HTTPS Only

‚úÖ **Vercel enforces HTTPS automatically**
- All traffic encrypted in transit
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- SSL certificates auto-renewed

### Content Security Policy

Next.js includes security headers:
```javascript
// next.config.js (already configured)
async headers() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/:path*',
      headers: [
        {
          key: 'X-Frame-Options',
          value: 'DENY'
        },
        {
          key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',
          value: 'nosniff'
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### XSS Protection

‚úÖ **React automatically escapes user input**
- All user-generated content is sanitized
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` used
- Project titles, descriptions are escaped

### Dependency Security

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix low-severity issues automatically
npm audit fix

# Review high-severity issues manually
npm audit fix --force  # Only if safe to do
```

**Current Status**: 32 low severity vulnerabilities in dev dependencies (hardhat, walletconnect). These are acceptable as they don't affect production.

---

## Deployment Security

### Never Commit Secrets

‚ùå **Never commit these files:**
```bash
.env
.env.local
.env.production
private_keys.txt
secrets.json
```

‚úÖ **Verify with:**
```bash
# Check .gitignore
cat .gitignore | grep .env

# Check git history doesn't have secrets
git log --all --full-history -- .env
```

### Environment Variables in Production

**For Vercel:**
1. Never commit `.env` to Git
2. Add variables in Vercel Dashboard:
   - Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Use separate values for:
   - Production
   - Preview
   - Development

**For Self-Hosted:**
```bash
# Use system environment variables
export NEXT_PUBLIC_REPUTATION_ADDRESS=0x...

# Or use a secrets manager
# - AWS Secrets Manager
# - HashiCorp Vault
# - Azure Key Vault
```

### Access Control

‚úÖ **Limit who can deploy:**
- Vercel: Restrict to team members only
- GitHub: Protect `main` branch
- CI/CD: Use branch protection rules

### Regular Updates

```bash
# Update dependencies monthly
npm update

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Update Next.js
npm install next@latest
```

## Wallet Security

### User Education

Provide clear guidance to users:

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts
- Verify transaction details before signing
- Check contract addresses match documentation
- Use trusted RPC endpoints
- Keep seed phrases offline and secure

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Share private keys or seed phrases
- Sign transactions without reading them
- Use suspicious wallet browser extensions
- Connect to unknown websites
- Store large amounts in hot wallets

### Transaction Warnings

The app includes clear warnings before transactions:

```typescript
// Example: Create project
"Creating this project will cost gas fees.
Transaction cannot be reversed once confirmed."

// Example: Fund project
"You are about to send {amount} ETH to this project.
Funds cannot be refunded once goal is reached."
```

### Network Verification

‚úÖ **Network Guard Component**
- Forces users to Base Sepolia network
- Shows clear warning if wrong network
- Prevents accidental mainnet transactions

```typescript
<NetworkGuard>
  {/* Content only shows on correct network */}
</NetworkGuard>
```

### Connection Security

‚úÖ **RainbowKit Integration**
- Supports multiple wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase, WalletConnect)
- Secure connection protocols
- Auto-disconnect on network change
- Session management

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### Error Tracking

**Recommended Setup:**

```javascript
// Add Sentry for error tracking
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
});
```

### What to Monitor

1. **Contract Events**
   - Genesis awards
   - Boost transactions
   - Project creations
   - Fund claims

2. **Frontend Errors**
   - Failed transactions
   - RPC errors
   - Wallet connection issues

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Page load times
   - Contract read/write times
   - RPC response times

### Incident Response Plan

**If a security issue is discovered:**

1. **Assess Severity**
   - Critical: Funds at risk
   - High: User data exposed
   - Medium: Service disruption
   - Low: Minor bug

2. **Immediate Actions**
   ```bash
   # For critical issues:
   # 1. Pause the frontend (if possible)
   vercel --prod --pause
   
   # 2. Notify users (via banner or social media)
   # 3. Investigate the issue
   # 4. Prepare a fix
   ```

3. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users immediately
   - Post status updates regularly
   - Explain the issue clearly
   - Provide remediation steps

4. **Resolution**
   - Deploy fix
   - Verify fix in production
   - Monitor for 24 hours
   - Post-mortem documentation
