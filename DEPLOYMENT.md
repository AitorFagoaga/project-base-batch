# ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - Meritocratic Launchpad

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Create `.env` file from `.env.example`
- [ ] Add your `PRIVATE_KEY` (wallet with Base Sepolia ETH)
- [ ] Set `BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` (default: https://sepolia.base.org)
- [ ] (Optional) Add `BASESCAN_API_KEY` for contract verification
- [ ] (Optional) Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/)

### 2. Get Base Sepolia ETH
Visit: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet
- Minimum: ~0.1 ETH for deployment + testing

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```powershell
npm install
```

### Step 2: Compile & Test Contracts
```powershell
npm run contracts:build
npm run contracts:test
```

Expected output: All tests passing âœ…

### Step 3: Deploy to Base Sepolia
```powershell
npm run contracts:deploy
```

**Save the output!** You'll see:
```
âœ… Reputation deployed at: 0x123...
âœ… Launchpad deployed at: 0xabc...
```

### Step 4: Update Frontend Environment
Copy the deployed addresses to `.env`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_REPUTATION_ADDRESS=0x123...
NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCHPAD_ADDRESS=0xabc...
```

### Step 5: (Optional) Seed Genesis Reputation
Edit `contracts/scripts/genesis.json` with your addresses:
```json
[
  {
    "address": "0xYourWalletAddress",
    "amount": 100,
    "reason": "Buildathon creator"
  },
  {
    "address": "0xAnotherAddress",
    "amount": 50,
    "reason": "Early tester"
  }
]
```

Then run:
```powershell
npm run contracts:seed
```

### Step 6: Start Frontend Locally
```powershell
npm run app:dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and test:
- [ ] Connect wallet (Base Sepolia)
- [ ] Create a project
- [ ] Fund a project
- [ ] Check reputation page
- [ ] Give a boost (if you have reputation)

### Step 7: Record Test Transactions
Save transaction hashes for submission:
```
Reputation deploy: 0x...
Launchpad deploy: 0x...
Create project: 0x...
Fund project: 0x...
Boost tx: 0x...
```

### Step 8: Deploy Frontend to Vercel
```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
cd app
vercel --prod
```

During deployment, add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=84532`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_REPUTATION_ADDRESS=0x...`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCHPAD_ADDRESS=0x...`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=...` (optional)

---

## Verification (Optional but Recommended)

If you have `BASESCAN_API_KEY`:

```powershell
cd contracts

# Verify Reputation
npx hardhat verify --network base-sepolia 0xREPUTATION_ADDRESS 86400 1 0 0xYOUR_OWNER_ADDRESS

# Verify Launchpad
npx hardhat verify --network base-sepolia 0xLAUNCHPAD_ADDRESS 0xREPUTATION_ADDRESS
```
